appdotnet-facades
=================

A set of CSS, JS, image, and other resources, to assist in giving App.Net apps
common visual aids.

AppDotNet-Facades is Twitter Bootstrap, and it's not. Twitter-Bootstrap orients
itself toward creating websites that look like, well, Twitter; AppDotNet-Facades
aims to provide general guidelines and beautiful functionality, without making
assumptions about the design of your application.

It's not just for web apps, though; if you're an iOS or Android developer and
would like to help me prepare resources so they can be used in your environments
as well, drop me a message, or even a pull request!
